# JavaScript: Static Node.js and Express Site
 The 6th project on the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree. This application is a back-end (or server-side) Express server used to display a fictional portfolio site, which showcases the projects I had built so far in my JavaScript Techdegree. It definies multiple routes, renders the corresponding Pug templates passing objects with dynamic data and handles 404 errors and global errors. I also took the oportunity in this project to practice my CSS skills and concepts like flexbox, background animations and hover animations.

 Main technologies: JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, CSS<br>
 Auxiliary technologies: HTML, Pug<br>
 Complexity level: Intermediate<br>
 Estimated Time to Complete: 25 hours<br>
 Concepts: Routes, Middleware, HTTP requests, Request Object, Response Object, Server, Static Assets, Modularization, Pug Template rendering, CSS Background animation, CSS Hover animation, CSS Flexbox<br>
